# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
The aim of this project was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, create report that summarizes my analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Overview
I was asked to provide two deliverables, specifically:
### The Number of Retiring Employees by Title  
* A query is written and executed to create a Retirement Titles table for employees who are born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955.
* A query is written and executed to create a Unique Titles table that contains the employee number, first and last name, and most recent title.
* A query is written and executed to create a Retiring Titles table that contains the number of titles filled by employees who are retiring.
* An export of this information is made available for the management team's review.

### The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
* A mentorship-eligibility table that holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.
* An export of this information is made available for the management team's review.

## Results
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables.

## Summary
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
